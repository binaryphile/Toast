# Skeletoast

Skeletoast is the combination of the Skeleton framework's nomenclature
over Toast's inline-block implementation.

I needed a grid system that didn't require clearfix markup since my CMS
didn't give me control over arbitrary markup.

However I was already used to Skeleton and liked it's features and
nomenclature.  Toast was a bit too simple since it didn't support 16
columns nor nested columns.

The result is a grid system which is:

- fluid - based on percentages not pixels (unlike Skeleton)
- responsive - using Toast's simple responsiveness model since
the need for Skeleton's more complex model is ameliorated by the
fluidity
- 16-column - using Skeleton's column naming and based on 960px width by
default (can be changed by editing the CSS)
- supports a single level of nested columns - no nested-nested columns
- does not support plurilization of one column ("one columns" is
invalid)

## How to use

First, link to skeletoast.css in your HTML document's head:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="[stylesheet path]/skeletoast.css">`

Then, to use the grid, you'll need a wrap and a grids container.
